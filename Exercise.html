    <h1 class="gs-xxlarge"><strong><u>Best Chest Exercises</u></strong></h1>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">Exercises that define and sculpt your chest help you look your best at the beach or the gym.
      They can also help you do a variety of daily tasks, like lifting or pushing objects. On top of all that, while you
      improve your look and strength, you lift your mood, too.</p>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">Working out the chest means working out the pectoral muscles, better known as the “pecs.” While
      the pecs are the largest muscles in the chest, there are actually several smaller muscles that support the
      pectoral muscles, including the latissimus dorsi muscles (or “lats”) on the sides of the chest and the trapezius
      muscle around the shoulders.</p>
    <h2 class="gs-xxlarge">Getting Started</h2>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">To make sure you work all the chest muscles, include a mix of motions in your chest workout
      routine:</p>
      <p class="gs-xlarge">Press using the flat or incline bench, dumbbells, or bar, or seated machine chest press.</p>
      <p class="gs-xlarge">Lift using the parallel bars, floor, or bench.</p>
      <p class="gs-xlarge">Pull using the cable fly bench, dumbbells, or cable crossovers.</p>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">If you’re a beginner, meet with a trainer to make sure you are following a good program with
      proper form during the exercises. Consider starting with a lower weight to reduce your risk of injury. You should
      be able to pick up the weight without too much strain. Remember, you can always go up in weight if the exercise
      seems too easy.</p>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">The number of reps and sets you do depends on your goal:</p>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">To increase size, try 1 to 3 sets of 8-12 reps for new or intermediate lifters or 3-6 sets of
      1-12 reps for seasoned lifters, of a weight that is at the higher end of your 1 rep max. Rest 1-2 minutes with
      more reps and up to 3 minutes for higher weight, lower rep sets.</p>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">To increase strength, try 1 to 3 sets of 8-12 reps for new or intermediate lifters or 2-6 sets
      of 1-8 reps for seasoned lifters, of a weight that is around 60-80 percent of your max, depending on your
      experience. Rest 1-2 minutes with more reps and up to 3 minutes for higher weight, lower rep sets.</p>

    <h1 class="gs-xxlarge"><u><strong>Best Back Exercises</strong></u></h1>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">Strengthening your back muscles can help prevent these types of injuries and ensure that your
      entire body works smoothly, both during daily movements and during exercise.</p>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">When we talk about your back, which muscles are we targeting? Primary muscles in the back
      include the:</p>
      <p class="xlarge">lats, which are in the area below your armpits down the sides of your back</p>
      <p class="xlarge">rhomboids, which are in the mid-upper back</p>
      <p class="xlarge">traps, which run from your neck to your mid back</p>
      <p class="xlarge">erector spinae, a group of muscles that run along your spine</p>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">All of the exercises below target a combination of these muscles.</p>
    <h2 class="gs-xxlarge">The Warmup</h2>
    <p class="gs-xlarge">Start with 5 to 10 minutes of moderate cardio to get your blood pumping and start to awaken
      your muscles. Then do a five-minute stretching sequence to prep your back for targeted exercises. This routine is
      a great starting point. Also, if at any point these moves cause you pain, stop what you’re doing and rest.</p>

<!----------------Best Exercises for Bigger, Stronger Arms-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1 class="xxlarge">Best Exercises for Bigger, Stronger Arms</h1>
<p class="xlarge">Having bigger, stronger arms can give you a feeling of confidence. Muscular arms can also convey a sense of athleticism and strength. But there are some important practical benefits to having stronger arms, too.</p>
<p class="xlarge">Anything that requires upper body effort — from picking up your kids to lifting heavy boxes — can be done more easily with stronger arms. In addition to boosting your daily functional fitness, having more muscle mass has the ability to:</p>
<p class="xlarge">increase your metabolism — this means your body will burn more calories, even when you’re not exercising</p>
<p class="xlarge">increase muscle endurance, strength, and tone</p>
<p class="xlarge">lower your chance of injury</p>
<p class="xlarge">The two main muscles in your upper arm are the biceps in the front and the triceps in the back. They’re opposite functioning muscle groups, so they require different types of exercises for strength training.</p>
